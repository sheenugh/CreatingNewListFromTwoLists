# This py file is trying on my own first, wherein I am testing myself if I can solve the exercise on my own like creating my own algorithm without

# Note: I watch the tutorial first in YT about how to use the specific function and apply it here in my task

# Given:
# list1 = [10, 20, 25, 30, 35]
# list2 = [40, 45, 60, 75, 90]

# Since the two given list consist of both even numbers, I'll be creating a new two list on my own

list1 = [10, 23, 27, 30, 31] #getting odd numbers in this list and transfer to the new list
list2 = [40, 45, 63, 75, 91] #getting even numbers in this list and transfer to the new list

for i in list1:
    pass
for j in list2:
    pass
print("New or Result List = ", [list1[1], list1[2], list1[4], list2[1], list2[0], list2[3]])
