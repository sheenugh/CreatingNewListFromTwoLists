Exercise 10: Create a new list from two list using the following condition
Create a new list from two list using the following condition

Given two list of numbers, write a program to create a new list such that the new list should contain odd numbers from the first list and even numbers from the second list.

Given:
list1 = [10, 20, 25, 30, 35]
list2 = [40, 45, 60, 75, 90]

Since the two given list consist of both even numbers, I'll be creating a new two list on my own

Expected Output:
result list: [25, 35, 40, 60, 90]
