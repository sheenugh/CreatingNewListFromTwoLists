# - Given List
    # Given:
    # list1 = [10, 20, 25, 30, 35]
    # list2 = [40, 45, 60, 75, 90]
    # Since the two given list consist of both even numbers, I'll be creating a new two list on my own.

list1 = [10, 23, 27, 30, 31] #getting odd numbers in this list and transfer to the new list.
list2 = [40, 45, 63, 75, 91] #getting even numbers in this list and transfer to the new list.
